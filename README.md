## Breakdown
### Lit Review
Papers:
- [1] Mairesse, F., & Walker, M. (2000). Words Mark the Nerds: Computational Models of Personality Recognition through Language. 28th Annual Conference of the Cognitive Science Society, (May), 543–548.
  > Spoken language is easier to model than written (which is good for us!) We can be constantly updating personality trait values through these decision trees.
- [2] Mairesse, F., Walker, M. A., Mehl, M. R., & Moore, R. K. (2007). Using linguistic cues for the automatic recognition of personality in conversation and text. Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 30, 457–500.
- [3] Schulman, D., & Bickmore, T. (2012). Changes in verbal and nonverbal conversational behavior in long-term interaction. Proceedings of the 14th ACM International Conference on Multimodal Interaction - ICMI ’12, 11.
  > Looks at how nonverbal behavior changes as a function of time/rapport.
Would be interesting to combine with Rishabh to create changing animations in the virtual agent.

### Research Questions
~1. When to collect user data~
  - Personality recognition, especially in the five major categories are best collected during the first interaction. Especially when there is anxiety and stress [2,3].
2. What to collect

## Logistics
Group meeting on Wednesdays at 5PM.

## General To-Do List for User Modeling and Memory

### Priority 1
- Read papers
- Think of large research questions

### Priority 2
- Start making an outline for lit review
