## Breakdown
### Lit Review
Papers:
- [1] Mairesse, F., & Walker, M. (2000). Words Mark the Nerds: Computational Models of Personality Recognition through Language. 28th Annual Conference of the Cognitive Science Society, (May), 543–548.
  > Spoken language is easier to model than written (which is good for us!) We can be constantly updating personality trait values through these decision trees.
- [2] Mairesse, F., Walker, M. A., Mehl, M. R., & Moore, R. K. (2007). Using linguistic cues for the automatic recognition of personality in conversation and text. Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 30, 457–500.
- [3] Schulman, D., & Bickmore, T. (2012). Changes in verbal and nonverbal conversational behavior in long-term interaction. Proceedings of the 14th ACM International Conference on Multimodal Interaction - ICMI ’12, 11.
  > Looks at how nonverbal behavior changes as a function of time/rapport.
Would be interesting to combine with Rishabh to create changing animations in the virtual agent.
- [4] Komatani, K., Ueno, S., Kawahara, T., & Okuno, H. G. (2003). Flexible Guidance Generation using User Model in Spoken Dialogue Systems, (July), 256–263.
  > Looks at the dimensions of what to collect about a user. In this case it's a virtual, dialogue-based assistant for navigating Kyoto's bus system.
- [5] van Beek, P. (1987). A model for generating better explanations. Proceedings of the 25th Annual Meeting on Association for Computational Linguistics -, 215–220.
  > Looks at how to use the goal and plans (in the long term) of the user should influence the explanation that a system output. Could be interesting collaboration with on-the-fly dialogue generation. But how would goals be inferred/stored?

### Research Questions
__1. When to collect user data?__
- Personality recognition, especially in the five major categories are best collected during the first interaction. Especially when there is anxiety and stress [1,2].
  
__2. What to collect?__
- Potential dimensions of what to store?
  - Skill level to the system =?= confidence in the system, knowledge of the target domain (algebra), ~degree of hastiness~, rapport (?) [4].
  - The five major personality categories: Extraversion, Neuroticism, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, Openness to Experience [1,2].
  - Goals and plans of the user [5].

__3. Can "skill level in system" be an analogue to "confidence in system"?__
- Talk to Rae about this.

__4. How to collect?__

__5. How to store all of the information?__

__6. When to use the information?__

__7. How to use the information?__

## Logistics
- Individual meeting with Michael on Wednesdays at 4:15PM
- Group meeting on Wednesdays at 5PM.

## General To-Do List for User Modeling and Memory

### Priority 1
- Read papers
- Think of large research questions

### Priority 2
- Start making an outline for lit review
